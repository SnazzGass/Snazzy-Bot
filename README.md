# Snazzy-Bot
A discord bot for doing things in the Mystic Mod discord server

Snazzy-Bot is hosted on repl.it at https://replit.com/@LeoEpperson/Snazzy-Bot#main.py

Currently Snazzy-Bot has two main functions:

1. It takes level codes from Cell Machine Mystic Mod and creates a preview image of the level.
2. It stores the level codes of common / popular levels so they can be retrieved quickly with a command. These levels are hard coded.
